    This project aims to develop an AI assistant that can assist in the detection and analysis of structural defects in images.
    The assistant uses Google Generative AI to analyze images and provide insights on potential defects.
    - **Defect Detection AI** - Automatically detects and analyzes structural defects in images using AI.
    - **Image Analysis** - Provides detailed analysis of structural defects in images.
    - **Recommendations** - Offers recommendations for addressing detected defects.
    - **Report Generation** - Generates reports based on the analysis of structural defects.
    - **User-Friendly Interface** - Easy-to-use interface for uploading images and viewing analysis results.
